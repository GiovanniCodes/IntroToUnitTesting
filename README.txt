Professional Practice Assignment 1 Report



Naming and Organization:
For our naming process, we named the tests similar to their respective tested- functions. For example, the bmiCalc function, defined in the main program, will be named bmiCalc_test for the respective testing.
For our structure, we decided to write the unit test cases based on each of the functions that a user can choose. In this case, we will be performing 6 unit tests for each of the respective functions and functionality that the program is intended to provide.
