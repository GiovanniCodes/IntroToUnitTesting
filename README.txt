Professional Practice Assignment 1 Report



Naming and Organization:
For our naming process, we named the tests similar to their respective tested- functions. For example, the bmiCalc function, defined in the main program, will be named bmiCalc_test for the respective testing.

For our structure, we decided to write the unit test cases based on each of the functions that a user can choose. In this case, we will be performing 6 unit tests for each of the respective functions and functionality that the program is intended to provide.

Setup and Execution Instructions:
Download Python 3.7 from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/
Download Pycharm from https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/

1. Python 3.7 , which will be used to execute the program functionality and execute the testing, must first be downloaded from the link above. Download and install based on your OS.

2. Pycharm will be used to compile and execute Python, running the written code and the test cases built.
Download and install the community version of Pycharm above, and install based on your OS.

3. Once both installations have finished, reboot your PC, and open Pycharm. Upon first running, Pycharm will give you the option of opening already made projects. First, open the PPA.py (.py files are Python files) file. Then, click on 'file' in the navigation bar, and open the PPA_test.py file. 

4. Now, run the PPA_test.py file by click on 'Run' and the built-in test cases will test the functionality of the PPA.py file.


At the time of writing, we have tested this functionality on two Windows 10 machines.
