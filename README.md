#Professional Practice Assignment 1 Report

##Naming and Organization:

For our naming process, we named the tests similar to their respective tested- functions. For example, the bmiCalc function, defined in the main program, will be named bmiCalc_test for the respective testing.

For our structure, we decided to write the unit test cases based on each of the functions that a user can choose. In this case, we will be performing 6 unit tests for each of the respective functions and functionality that the program is intended to provide.

Describe your unit testing & TDD experience. What do you think of unit testing & TDD? Do you think itâ€™s useful for a real project? Benefits & Drawbacks to TDD

Giovanni Gaspard

Unit testing and TDD is a wonderful way to have control of your program and allows you to break it down your code. It enables you to find your errors by breaking the project down into sections. It is useful for a real project and as a previous intern I know big coportatings are already using this approach. Throughout a sprint a designated tester handles the scripts to run a test for new functions created in the sprint. The benfit of Test Driven Development is the code is broken down and tested for errors. This will lead to not having a hard time to find an error later on. The drawback to me is the time needed to always have a test. Sometimes its hard to write a test for a specific function.Changes in the code mean changes to test.

##Setup and Execution Instructions:

Download Python 3.7 from [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-370/) 
Download Pycharm from [https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/)  


1. Python 3.7 , which will be used to execute the program functionality and execute the testing, must first be downloaded from the link above. Download and install based on your OS.

2. Pycharm will be used to compile and execute Python, running the written code and the test cases built.
Download and install the community version of Pycharm above, and install based on your OS.

3. Once both installations have finished, reboot your PC, and open Pycharm. Upon first running, Pycharm will give you the option of opening already made projects. First, open the PPA.py (.py files are Python files) file. Then, click on 'file' in the navigation bar, and open the PPA_test.py file. 

4. Now, run the PPA_test.py file by click on 'Run' and the built-in test cases will test the functionality of the PPA.py file.


At the time of writing, we have tested this functionality on two Windows 10 machines.
